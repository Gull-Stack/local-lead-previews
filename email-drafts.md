## 1. RG Plumbing Inc. — South Jordan

**To:** info@rgplumbing.com (or find owner contact)
**Subject:** Quick website question for RG Plumbing

---

Hi,

I've been a fan of RG Plumbing's reputation in South Jordan — 40 years of service is no small feat. Most plumbers don't make it 5.

I came across your website recently and noticed a few things that might be costing you calls:

**Current Site Issues:**
• No photos of your actual team or trucks
• No customer reviews visible on homepage
• Mobile experience is a bit rough
• No online scheduling option

For a company with your history and reputation, your website should be your best salesperson — working 24/7 to bring in new customers.

I put together a quick mockup of what a modern site could look like for you:

No obligation — I just wanted to show you what's possible. If you'd like to chat about it, I'm happy to hop on a 10-minute call.

Best,

## 2. Gordon Family Dental — Lehi

**To:** Via website contact form or call (801) 766-6344
**Subject:** Quick idea for Gordon Family Dental's online presence

---

Hi Dr. Gordon,

I came across Gordon Family Dental while researching dental practices in Lehi. The reviews are great — patients clearly love you guys.

But I noticed your website might not be doing your practice justice:

**What I noticed:**
• The design feels a bit dated (first impressions matter!)
• Your CEREC same-day crown tech isn't prominently featured
• No online appointment booking
• Mobile experience could be smoother

New patients often choose based on the website before they ever call. A modern, trust-building site can be the difference between booking and bouncing.

I mocked up what a refresh could look like:
👉 https://gull-stack.github.io/local-lead-previews/gordon-dental/

Would love to show you what's possible. Happy to chat for 10 minutes if you're interested.

Best,

## 3. Toscano Restaurant — Draper

**To:** Via website or in-person
**Subject:** Helping Toscano shine online

---

Hi,

I'm a local who's enjoyed more than a few dinners at Toscano (that lobster fettuccine 👨‍🍳). The food speaks for itself.

But I noticed your website might be leaving some diners on the table:

**What I saw:**
• Site is HTTP only (not HTTPS) — browsers flag this as "not secure"
• No online reservations (OpenTable integration?)
• Menu is basic text — could be beautiful
• No photos of the restaurant or dishes
• Mobile experience is limited

Restaurants live and die by first impressions. When someone Googles "Italian restaurant Draper" and lands on your site, it should make them hungry — not confused.

I put together a vision of what Toscano could look like online:
👉 https://gull-stack.github.io/local-lead-previews/toscano-restaurant/

I'd love to chat about bringing your online presence up to the level of your food. No pressure, just a conversation.

Buon appetito,

1. **Personalize the subject** — use their name or business
2. **Lead with compliment** — show you know them
3. **Specific problems** — not vague "your site needs work"
4. **Show, don't tell** — link to preview site
5. **Low-pressure CTA** — "10 minute call" not "buy now"
6. **Follow up in 3 days** if no response
